# A* Path Visualization Tool 🚀

Welcome to the A* Path Visualization Tool! This tool visually demonstrates the A* search algorithm, a widely used pathfinding and graph traversal algorithm, using a graphical interface built with Pygame.

## Overview 🌟

This project allows users to interactively set start and end points, draw barriers, and watch the A* algorithm in action as it finds the shortest path between two points on a grid.

### Features ✨

- **Interactive Grid** 🖱️: Users can click to set start and end points and draw barriers.
- **Real-Time Visualization** ⏱️: The algorithm's process is shown step-by-step, providing a clear understanding of how A* works.
- **Pathfinding Algorithm** 🧭: Implements the A* algorithm, which is known for its efficiency and accuracy in finding the shortest path.

### Controls 🎮

- **Left Click** 🖱️: 
  - Set the **start point** (first click).
  - Set the **end point** (second click).
  - Draw **barriers** (subsequent clicks).

- **Right Click** 🖱️:
  - Erase barriers, start point, or end point.

- **Space Bar** ␣: 
  - Start the A* algorithm to find the path.

- **C Key** 🔄: 
  - Clear the grid and reset the start and end points.

### Visualization Colors 🎨

- **Red** 🔴: Closed nodes (already evaluated).
- **Green** 🟢: Open nodes (currently being evaluated).
- **White** ⚪: Unvisited nodes.
- **Black** ⚫: Barriers (unpassable).
- **Orange** 🟠: Start node.
- **Turquoise** 🟦: End node.
- **Purple** 🟣: Path found by the algorithm.

## Purpose 🎯

This project is an educational tool designed to help users understand the A* search algorithm through interactive visualization. It is suitable for students, educators, and anyone interested in learning about pathfinding algorithms in a hands-on manner.

Enjoy exploring and learning with the A* Path Visualization Tool! 🎉
